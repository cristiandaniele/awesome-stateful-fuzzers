# awesome-stateful-fuzzers

This repository contains a list of stateful fuzzers, organised according to the categories presented in the survey paper ["Fuzzers for stateful systems: Survey and Research Directions"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3648468) by
Cristian Daniele, Seyed Gingham Andarzian and Erik Poll
that appeared in ACM Computing Surveys in April 2024.

Since the publication of that survey several new stateful fuzzers have been appeared. To keep track of them we started this github page. In fact, there have also been more survey papers about stateful fuzzing (aka protocol fuzzing or stateful protocol fuzzing); we also list these below.

Information about the new stateful fuzzers that we summarise includes: which category from our survey paper it belongs to; whether it uses passive learning or active learning to infer state machines; whether it requires source code; whether it observes branch coverage in the style of ALF; the case studies it has been evaluated on; and which other stateful fuzzers it has been compared with.

## Short background on fuzzing of stateful systems

**Fuzzing** is a testing technique which has been proven very effective in finding vulnerabilities in software. In a nutshell, a fuzzer sends millions of slightly malformed messages to an SUT (System Under Test) hoping to detect crashes which signal vulnerabilities, typically memory corruption flaws.
Fuzzers use various tricks (grammars, seed files with sample messages, code-coverage-guided evolution, ...) to cleverly generate messages to feed to the SUT, with the goal to maximise code coverage and find as many bugs as possible.

Most fuzzers target *stateless* systems. Here the processing of an input message does not depend on previous inputs. Typical examples are graphics libraries for viewing or converting images.

However, many systems, for instance protocol implementations, are *stateful*. Here the system keeps an internal state to be able to properly process *sequences of messages* aka *traces*.  For example, an FTP server needs to remember that the user *Cris* already inserted the correct password. The internal state recorded by the SUT which then influences the way in which future messages are processed complicates the job for the fuzzer.  To fuzz a stateless system the fuzzer only has to mutate individual messages, but to fuzz a stateful system the fuzzer should not just mutate messages but also the order of messages in traces.

Fuzzers for stateful systems can use different approaches to deal with the statefulness of the SUT.  One approach is to use *active automata learning* to infer state machines. The original active learning algorithm is Angluin's L\*, but there are newer variants, implemented in libraries such as [LearnLib](https://github.com/LearnLib/learnlib) and [AALPy](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy).
Fuzzers can use active learning as ingredient for their approach, but active learning algorithms can also be regarded as fuzzers in their own right, albeit fuzzers that are limited in the sense that they will not mutate individual messages but only mutate the order of messages.
The [Automata Wiki](https://automata.cs.ru.nl) by [Frits Vaandrager](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~fvaan) and colleagues collects many examples where active learning has been used. Some simple examples of active learning for FTP servers are discussed [here](https://github.com/cristiandaniele/ftp-statemodel-learner).

Another approach is to use *passive learning algorithms* that infer state machines from a set of traces after these have been collected.  [FlexFringe](https://github.com/tudelft-cda-lab/FlexFringe) is a library that provides passive learning algorithms; some passive learning algorithms have also been added to [AALPy](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy).

## Categories of fuzzers from our survey paper
- **Grammar Based**: These require some grammar as input. This can be the grammar for the messages or the grammar of the traces, or both. The grammar for the traces, i.e. the message sequences, is often thought of as a finite state machine. This grammar is used as basis to produce (slightly) malformed messages and message sequences.
- **Grammar Learner**: Instead of requiring a grammar as input, these automatically infer a grammar for the message structure or a grammar (aka state model) for the message sequences or the message structure starting from messages or traces.
- **Evolutionary**: In the evolutionary style popularised by afl, these fuzzers observe execution paths to discover interesting mutations of the initial set of messages (often called seed files).
- **Evolutionary  Grammar-based**: These also take the evolutionary approach, like the Evolutionary fuzzers, but take a grammar as input.
- **Evolutionary Grammar-learner**: These take a similar approach as Evolutionary Grammar-based fuzzers, but they try to *infer* the state model or the structure of the messages.
- **Man in the Middle**: Very different from the above-mentioned ones, they sit between client and server, intercept messages, mutate and forward them.
- **Machine Learning based**: This category contains fuzzers that rely on ML techniques to produce *ready-to-forward* messages or traces.

## What do the fields mean? 
- **Fuzzer Name**: quite easy
- **Based on**: fuzzer, approach or methodology the *fuzzer* relies on.
- **Mutates**: Which part of the input the *fuzzer* mutates. Options are: **messages**, **traces** or **both**.
- **Input Needed**: Input the *fuzzer* needs in input. Options are: **messages**, **traces**, **PCAP file**, ...
- **Feedback System** (same as **Feedback (i)**): Technique/s the *fuzzer* uses to mutate the messages.
- **Feedback (ii)**: Technique/s the *fuzzer* uses to mutate the message orders.
- **Limitations**: Limitations that characterize the *fuzzer*.

## Recent papers about stateful fuzzers

### CSFuzzer

[CSFuzzer: A grey-box fuzzer for network protocol using context-aware state feedback](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404825002706), by Xiangpu Son, Yingpei Zeng, Jianliang Wu, Hao Li, Chaoshun Zuo, Qingchuan Zhao, and Shanqing Guo, Computers & Security, Vol. 157, 2025.

CSFuzzer automatically identifies variables in the program code that it thinks are used to record state information. Here it distinguishes two kinds of state variables: protocol-state variables and sub-state variables. It then uses a new state coverage metric (CAST-Coverage, for context-aware state transition coverage) to guide the fuzzing.  So CSFuzzer is similar to SGFuzz and StateFuzz in that it observes program variables and automatically infers which variables to observe.  The implementation of CSFuzzer is based on AFL.  

So CSFuzzer is a white-box fuzzer (it requires access to the source code), it observes branch coverage (in the style of AFL), and it does not make use of passive or active learning algorithms to infer state machines.

CSFuzzer has been compared against 8 other fuzzers
- AFL, AFL++, AFLNET, StateAFL, IJON, SGFUZZ, ChatAFL and NSFuzz  

on the 12 implementations and 9 protocols
- PureFTPD and BFTPD (FTP), ippsample and CUPS (IPP), Live555 (RTSP), DCMTK (DICOM), Exim (SMTP), Dnsmasq (DNS), Curl, OpenSSL (TLS), MbedTLS and TinyDTLS (DTLS)
